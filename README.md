# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This case study aims at applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques of EDA, we will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
